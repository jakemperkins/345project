## Anti time-wasting app development

We are building an Android app to discourage time-wasting!
We think that time-wasting is a bad thing and hope to encourage users to spend their time better by helping them turn productive activities into lasting habits.
We currently have a Timer page where users can set the app down when they want to do something and come back when they have finished to see how long they have spent on that activity. We also have implemented a page where users can see a graph of their previous “Sessions” as we are calling them, and sort by type of session and time period.
We aim to implement features including a personal and customisable avatar, passive-aggressive push notifications and a friends system. We will make our app graphics-based, with the user avatar taking centre stage on the opening page. Other features we are wanting to develop include an in-app store where users can trade their in-app currency for avatar customisations, and an ideas page where users can read through suggested ways to waste less time.
