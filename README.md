## Anti time-wasting app development


Our team is building an Android app to discourage time-wasting. We think that time-wasting is a bad thing and hope to encourage users to spend their time more productively by playing into people’s competitive nature by helping them waste less time than their peers. We aim to implement features including a personal and customisable avatar, passive-aggressive push notifications and a friends system. We chose to build an Android app because the majority of our group has phones that run Android. As we know the Android operating system is better than the iOS operating system, it will be easier for us to access different software, transfer skills and knowledge, and develop an app that both works well for Android phones and that appeals to Android users. We will make our app graphics-based, with the user avatar taking centre stage on the opening page. We will have a menu to take the user to other parts of the app like a statistics page where they can see how they are stacking up compared to average figures, their friend’s figures, and previous personal trends. Other pages we will implement include an in-app store where users can trade their in-app currency for avatar customisations, an ideas page where users can take a look through suggested ways to waste less time, and a timer page where users can start, monitor, or stop a timer that is keeping track of the time they are not wasting.
